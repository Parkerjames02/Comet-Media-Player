## ☄️ Comet Media Player
The comet media player application is a simple space theme media player that can play various video and audio file formats. 
## ✨ Technologies

- GUI
- Plays video files
- Plays audio files
## 🚀 Features
- File select
- Plays mp4, mkv, and wmv video files
- Plays mp3, wav, and m4a audio files
## 📌 The Reason
I made this simple media player for my C# class final project to showcase what I had learned during the length of the class. The main goals of this application was to have a GUI with multiple elements such as buttons and text boxes, accept user input, display a background image, and play sound.
## 📖 How To Use
All the user has to do is click the "Open" to open the file eplorer and select whatever video or audio file that they would
like to play. Once the file is selected the video or audio will begin to play and the name of the file will be displayed in
the text box right above the "Open" button. In the case that an audio file is selected the screen will show an audio
visualizer. The media can be paused with the pause/play button and the volume of the media can be adjusted with the volume
slider.
